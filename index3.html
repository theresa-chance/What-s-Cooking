		<p>Religious festivals, customs and traditions form an integral part of Trinidad and Tobago’s society and the Hindu festival, Divali is no exception.  
		This stems from a large portion of the country’s population being East Indians and a significant amount are Hindus.  
		Divali was brought to Trinidad and Tobago by Hindus who came as indentured labourers in 1845. 
		The celebration of Divali in Trinidad and Tobago is marked as a national holiday with numerous functions held to celebrate the occasion.
		The celebration of Divali in Trinidad is one of the largest in the English speaking Caribbean.  
		Celebrations are not only held at temples and by religious groups, it has been extended to homes and communities 
		but now organizations have also embraced this festival with special events held to commemorate this occasion</p>
		<p>
		Bamboo structures are set up in open, grassy fields, in homes or driveways, or in public places.
		Lit clay lanterns called “deyas” are then arranged on the bamboo frames. Observant Hindus will fast, pray, and seek the blessings of the goddess Lakshmi on this day as well.
		Many families will enjoy special dishes and desserts, and food is often given away to neighbours.</p>
