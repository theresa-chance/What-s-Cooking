		<p>Trinidadians love to eat, cook and share food. As diverse as the people and history are, the culinary landscape is almost beyond “fusion”. 
		The native Amerindians discovered how to remove the poison from cassava, made staples of corn, pineapples, guavas, pawpaw, avocadoes, and cocoa. 
		Root tubers, pigeon peas, saltfish, callaloo, black pudding and souse were all inherited as “creole food” from local African descendants. 
		The European plantation era ensured that citrus, mangoes, sugar cane, coffee and pickled things became part of the local culture, 
		while the indentured Indians introduced more spices, curries and cooking skills from the east. 
		Therefore, the culinary traditions of four continents blended with Trinidadian flamboyance which have been handed down from generation to 
		generation have made food, and sharing it with friends, a favorite local pastime.</p>
		<p>Learn how to experiance our culture through our food; whether it is Christmas, Divali, Lent, or even just some Street Food.
		Get to know how to prepare some of our local cuisine.</p>
